# Caffeinator-1000
Get in loser, weâ€™re making coffee.

## Ideas
Replicate chemex / pour-over process, using sensors and electronic actuation to have complete control over the brewing process. Should work with any glass pour-over devices.

Using a electronic valve and flow rate meter you can dispense water by-the-ml (gram). Auto calculation of brew ratios, you can auto-dispense the desired ratio for a given mass of coffee. 

Using temperature sensors and pre-heat routines, you can dial in temperature at the exit of the nozzle to the exact degree C/F you desire.

Can program in bloom time, PWM the flow rate for brew time, etc.
