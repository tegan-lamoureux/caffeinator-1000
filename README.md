## Ideas
Replicate chemex / pour-over process, using gravity-fed water dispensing, sensors and electronic actuation to have complete control over the brewing process. Should work with any glass pour-over devices.

Using a electronic valve and flow rate meter you can dispense water by-the-ml (gram). Auto calculation of brew ratios, you can auto-dispense the exact volume/mass of water for a given mass of coffee. 

Using temperature sensors and pre-heat routines, you can dial in temperature at the exit of the nozzle to the exact degree C/F you desire.

Pre-heat routine can pwm at-temp water through the system with a given dwell time. Calculate the temperature delta to get the desired temp at the outflow nozzle. 

Small programmable hotplate for pre-heating and heat-loss mitigation (control to the exact degree).

Can program in bloom time, PWM the flow rate for brew time, etc.
